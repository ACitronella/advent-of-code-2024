# My solution for Advent of code 2024

My attempt to practice haskell. A yearly one.

## Structure of the repository
```
day%d/
    | small_input.txt
    | input.txt
    | first_half.[py|hs]
    | second_half.[py|hs]
```
Each folder contain both inputs and problems of the day.  
Example input is localed in `small_input.txt`, and the actual input of the problem is localted in `input.txt`.  
The programming language used in each day is decided by my mood.

## Language used so far

- Python
- Haskell
<!-- - C (day 4) -->

## How to run

Python3 (require python 3 interpreter)
```bash
python file-name.py
```

<!-- C (require gcc for compilation)
```bash
gcc file-name.c -o file_name
./file_name
``` -->

Haskell (require ghc for complication)
```bash
ghc file-name.hs
./file-name
```
